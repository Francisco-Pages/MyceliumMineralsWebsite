# 1. Product Requirements Document

## 1.1 Overview

Mycelium Minerals requires a public-facing corporate website that serves as the company's primary digital presence. The site will communicate the company's investment thesis, showcase its portfolio of gold and silver production projects in Bolivia, present leadership, and provide institutional and retail investors with all information needed to evaluate and engage with the company.

## 2.3 Content Delivery Strategy

| Content Type | Strategy | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Homepage | ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration, 60s revalidation) | Fast load; content stays fresh |
| Project pages | ISR (5-min revalidation) | Projects change infrequently |
| News / Press Releases | ISR (60s revalidation) | Near-real-time without full SSR overhead |
| IR documents | Static (on-demand revalidation via Sanity webhook) | Changes on publish only |
| Careers | ISR (5-min revalidation) | Jobs added/removed via CMS webhook |
| Contact / Forms | SSR (API routes) | Server-side validation and email delivery |

## 2.4 Internationalization (i18n) Architecture

- **Supported locales:** `en` (English, default), `es` (Spanish), `fr` (French)
- **Routing:** `/projects` (EN), `/es/proyectos` (ES), `/fr/projets` (FR)
- **Implementation:** `next-intl` with locale-prefixed routing via Next.js App Router middleware
- **Translations:** UI strings stored in `/messages/en.json`, `es.json`, `fr.json`
- **CMS content:** Sanity documents have localized fields for all text content using `@sanity/language-filter` plugin
- **Language switcher:** Persists current page path when switching locales; falls back to homepage if translation not available
- **SEO:** `hreflang` alternate tags on all pages for all locales

## 2.5 CMS Data Model (Sanity Schemas)

```
Content Types:
├── project              (name, slug, stage, location, description, resources, documents, photos)
├── teamMember           (name, title, bio, headshot, type: executive|board)
├── pressRelease         (title, date, body, category, pdf attachment)
├── irDocument           (title, type, date, file, language)
├── jobListing           (title, location, type, description, applicationEmail, active)
├── esgInitiative        (title, description, pillar: E|S|G, metrics, partnerName)
├── siteSettings         (company name, IR contact, social links, ticker symbol)
└── pageContent          (homepage hero, about story — flexible content blocks)

All schemas include localized fields for EN / ES / FR.
```

## 2.6 AWS Infrastructure

```
AWS Services:
├── Amplify             — Next.js hosting + CI/CD (auto-deploy on Git push)
├── CloudFront          — CDN (built into Amplify; custom domain SSL)
├── S3                  — Media and document storage (private bucket, signed URLs for PDFs)
├── SES                 — Transactional email (contact form, newsletter subscriptions)
├── Route 53            — DNS management
└── IAM                 — Role-based access for Amplify, SES, S3

Environments:
├── Production          — myceliumminerals.com (main branch)
├── Staging             — staging.myceliumminerals.com (staging branch)
└── Preview             — Auto-generated per pull request (Amplify previews)
```

## 2.7 Third-Party Integrations

| Integration | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| TMX Money / FMP API | TSX live stock price | Client-side React component fetching stock data on page load |
| Mapbox GL JS | Interactive Bolivia project map | Client-side map component; lazy-loaded |
| Google Analytics 4 | Page analytics and event tracking | Via `@next/third-parties/google` |
| Sanity Webhooks | Trigger ISR revalidation on CMS publish | POST to Next.js `/api/revalidate` endpoint |
| Formspree or AWS SES | Contact form delivery | API route + SES transport |

## 2.8 Security

- All environment variables server-side only (never exposed to client)
- Sanity API token with read-only access for public site; write access only from Sanity Studio
- S3 PDFs served via signed URLs with short expiry (prevents direct hotlinking)
- Contact form: rate limiting (5 submissions/IP/hour) via middleware
- CSP headers configured in `next.config.js`
- No PII stored in application — email subscriptions handled by SES/third-party list service

# 3. Design Document

## 3.1 Design Philosophy

**Bold. Modern. Honest.**

Mycelium's visual language is confident and direct — like the company itself. The design draws inspiration from Pinecone.io's aesthetic: clean white backgrounds with crisp black linear outlines, sharp geometric shapes, and high-contrast accent colors that punch through the whitespace. This is a deliberate departure from the dark-navy corporate templates typical of mining companies — Mycelium stands out as transparent, contemporary, and unafraid.

The "honest" pillar means no stock-photo gloss. Real project photos, real people, real data — presented with clarity rather than marketing veneer.

## 3.2 Color System

### Primary Palette

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary background — clean, open, honest |
| **Obsidian** | `#0A0A0A` | Primary text, outlines, borders, icons |
| **Off-white** | `#F5F4F0` | Section backgrounds, cards — slight warmth |

### Accent Colors (Sharp, Contrasting)

| Name | Hex | Usage |
|------|-----|-------|
| **Mineral Gold** | `#D4A853` | Primary CTA buttons, highlights, key metrics — gold commodity link |
| **Bolivian Green** | `#2D6A4F` | ESG section, sustainability, positive indicators |
| **Copper** | `#B55A2B` | Secondary accent; hover states; project markers on map |
| **Alert Red** | `#C0392B` | Errors, warnings only |

### Usage Rules

- Backgrounds are always White or Off-white — no dark backgrounds except hero overlays
- Text is always Obsidian on light backgrounds — never grey-on-grey
- Accents are used sparingly — one accent color per section maximum
- Black outlines (1–2px) are used on cards, buttons, and graphic elements to create the linear, editorial feel

## 3.3 Typography

### Typefaces

| Role | Font | Weight | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| Display / Hero | **Clash Display** | 600–700 | Bold, geometric — makes a statement; free via Fontshare |
| Headings (H2–H4) | **Inter** | 600–700 | Clean, modern, highly readable |
| Body | **Inter** | 400–500 | Consistent system with headings |
| Mono / Data | **JetBrains Mono** | 400 | Financial figures, stock prices, technical data |
| Labels / Caps | **Inter** | 700, uppercase, tracked | Section labels, navigation, tags |

### Type Scale (rem, base 16px)

| Name | Size | Usage |
|------|------|-------|
| Display | 4.5rem (72px) | Hero headlines |
| H1 | 3rem (48px) | Page titles |
| H2 | 2rem (32px) | Section titles |
| H3 | 1.5rem (24px) | Sub-sections, card titles |
| H4 | 1.25rem (20px) | Labels within cards |
| Body | 1rem (16px) | Paragraph text |
| Small | 0.875rem (14px) | Captions, metadata |
| Mono | 1rem (16px) | Financial data |

## 3.4 Spacing & Grid

- **Base unit:** 4px
- **Grid:** 12-column, max-width 1280px, 24px gutters (desktop), 16px (mobile)
- **Section padding:** 80px top/bottom (desktop), 48px (mobile)
- **Card border-radius:** 0px — sharp corners reinforce the linear aesthetic
- **Border style:** 1.5px solid `#0A0A0A` — used on cards, buttons, dividers
